# Post-processing for separation fairness

This repo shows a minimal example of how the model scores of a classifier can be post-processed in order to achieve separation fairness. This code is for purely didactical purposes, written *only* for this specific example.
The post-processing algorithm used is that presented by Hardt, Price and Srebro in http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413
The blog for which this code was written: https://faculty.ai/blog/
